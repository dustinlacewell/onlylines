# Welcome to OnlyLines

All the visuals you see here are generated using **only lines**.

Specifically, *straight* lines locked to the *perimeter of the canvas*.

No curves, gradients, shadows, or textures. Only *__lines__*!

## Quick Start
- Click anywhere to generate a new piece
- **Shape Tab**: How lines are initially placed 
- **Motion Tab**: How endpoints move along the perimeter
- **Color/Alpha/Width/Dash Tabs**: Animated visual effects

**BTW**: The parameter space is huge, so randomly generating patterns can produce a lot of duds. Use the UI to make something cool!
